# üåç Terraform Detailed Guide (Expanded Version)

## 1. Introduction

Terraform is the foundation of infrastructure provisioning in this repository. 
It brings the principle of "infrastructure as code" (IaC) into practice, enabling teams to define, version, and reproduce 
cloud environments in a consistent and auditable way. Without Terraform, developers would have to rely on manual console 
operations or ad-hoc scripts, which are error-prone and non-reproducible.

The decision to use Terraform here is intentional. It allows the repository to remain cloud-agnostic at a conceptual level 
while still leveraging the AWS provider for real deployments. This separation of infrastructure from applications means 
that Kubernetes clusters, networking, and load balancers can be created or destroyed with a single workflow execution.

---

## 2. Philosophy of Terraform in This Repository

Terraform is more than just a provisioning tool; it is a control mechanism that defines **what exists** in the cloud and ensures 
that the current state matches the desired state. The philosophy followed here includes:

- **Declarative Infrastructure**: Resources are defined in `.tf` files and applied consistently across environments.  
- **Parameterization with tfvars**: Each environment (dev, test, prod) has its own `.tfvars` file, ensuring separation of concerns.  
- **Automation via GitHub Actions**: Terraform is invoked automatically through workflows, eliminating manual steps.  
- **Safety through Planning**: Every apply is preceded by a plan, giving visibility into changes.  
- **Reversibility**: Infrastructure can be destroyed just as easily as it can be created.

## 3. Terraform Integration with the Workflow

Terraform is conditionally executed when the GitHub Actions workflow input `run_terraform` is set to true. 
The specific action Terraform performs is controlled by the `action` input (`apply`, `destroy`, or `refresh`).

### Example Workflow Snippet

```yaml
jobs:
  terraform:
    if: ${{ github.event.inputs.run_terraform == 'true' }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Terraform
        uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v2

      - name: Terraform Init
        run: terraform init

      - name: Terraform Plan
        run: terraform plan -var-file=environments/${{ github.event.inputs.environment }}.tfvars

      - name: Terraform Apply
        if: ${{ github.event.inputs.action == 'apply' }}
        run: terraform apply -auto-approve -var-file=environments/${{ github.event.inputs.environment }}.tfvars

      - name: Terraform Destroy
        if: ${{ github.event.inputs.action == 'destroy' }}
        run: terraform destroy -auto-approve -var-file=environments/${{ github.event.inputs.environment }}.tfvars

      - name: Terraform Refresh
        if: ${{ github.event.inputs.action == 'refresh' }}
        run: terraform refresh -var-file=environments/${{ github.event.inputs.environment }}.tfvars
```

This snippet illustrates how Terraform is integrated directly into the workflow, tied to the parameters that users choose.

## 4. Terraform Commands in Depth

### `terraform init`
This command sets up the working directory, downloads provider plugins, and configures remote backends. 
It is the first step required before any plan or apply.

### `terraform plan`
The plan phase calculates the actions Terraform will take to reconcile the desired state with the current state. 
This is vital for visibility. In a GitHub Actions run, the plan output is visible in the logs, giving reviewers confidence 
before apply is executed.

### `terraform apply`
The apply phase provisions resources. In this repository, it creates networking components, a Kubernetes cluster, 
node pools, and load balancers. The `-auto-approve` flag is used in automation to skip manual confirmation.

### `terraform refresh`
This synchronizes Terraform state with real-world resources. If a resource has been modified outside Terraform, 
refresh updates the state file to reflect reality. This helps detect drift.

### `terraform destroy`
The destroy command tears down resources. It is useful for cost management, allowing temporary environments 
to be created and destroyed as needed.

---

## 5. Environment Variables and tfvars

Terraform is driven by `.tfvars` files that define values for variables. Each environment has its own tfvars file:

- `dev.tfvars`
- `test.tfvars`
- `prod.tfvars`

### Example `dev.tfvars`

```hcl
region = "us-east-1"
cluster_name = "dev-cluster"
node_count = 2
node_instance_type = "t3.medium"
```

This configuration ensures that the dev environment is small and cost-efficient, while test or prod tfvars 
can scale up resources.

By parameterizing environments, teams ensure that clusters do not interfere with each other and can be tuned individually.

---

## 6. State Management and Drift Handling

Terraform maintains a state file that records the resources it manages. 
In automation, this state is typically stored remotely to allow collaboration and prevent corruption. 
While this repository defaults to local state for simplicity, production deployments are recommended 
to use remote state (e.g., S3 with DynamoDB locking).

### Why Remote State?

- Collaboration: Multiple developers can work on the same infrastructure without overwriting each other‚Äôs state.  
- Safety: DynamoDB locking prevents concurrent applies.  
- Auditability: Remote state is versioned and recoverable.  

### Drift Detection

When resources are modified outside Terraform (e.g., manually changing a security group in AWS), drift occurs. 
Running `terraform refresh` or `terraform plan` reveals drift by comparing real-world resources with the state file. 
This ensures that Terraform remains the source of truth.

---


## 7. AWS Resources Provisioned

When `terraform apply` is executed, the following AWS resources are typically created in this repository‚Äôs context:

- **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**  
  Defines the isolated network where Kubernetes nodes and services run.

- **Subnets**  
  Public and private subnets spread across availability zones for resilience.

- **Internet Gateway and NAT Gateway**  
  Allow outbound internet access for nodes while securing internal traffic.

- **Security Groups**  
  Define ingress and egress rules for cluster communication and external access.

- **EKS Cluster (or equivalent)**  
  Managed Kubernetes control plane that hosts workloads.

- **Node Groups**  
  Worker nodes that run pods. Instance size and count are defined in tfvars.

- **Load Balancers**  
  Expose Node.js, NGINX, and k8sGPT applications externally.

Each resource is explicitly defined and linked, ensuring predictable environments.

---

## 8. Secrets and Authentication

Terraform requires cloud credentials to perform provisioning. These are never stored in code. Instead, GitHub Secrets 
are used:

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

These values are injected at runtime. The workflow ensures that secrets are masked in logs, preventing accidental exposure.

```yaml
env:
  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
```

This design follows best practices for secret management in CI/CD pipelines.

---

## 9. Error Handling in Terraform

Errors can arise from many sources: invalid tfvars, quota limits, or AWS service issues. The workflow addresses these 
scenarios through visibility and fail-fast behavior.

### Example: Invalid tfvars
If a developer sets `node_instance_type = "invalid.type"`, Terraform plan fails immediately. Logs in the workflow show the error.

### Example: Quota Exceeded
If too many load balancers are already allocated in a region, Terraform apply will fail. Developers must either increase quotas 
or adjust resources.

### Example: Network Conflicts
If a VPC CIDR overlaps with an existing network, Terraform plan will highlight conflicts before applying.

This feedback loop ensures errors are caught early, and environments are not left half-deployed.

---

## 10. Case Studies

### Case: Apply
A developer triggers the workflow with:
- `environment=dev`
- `action=apply`
- `run_terraform=true`

Result: Terraform provisions a dev cluster, networking, and load balancers.

### Case: Destroy
Parameters:
- `environment=dev`
- `action=destroy`
- `run_terraform=true`

Result: Terraform tears down all resources, freeing costs and cleaning up networks.

### Case: Refresh
Parameters:
- `environment=test`
- `action=refresh`
- `run_terraform=true`

Result: Terraform syncs state with actual AWS resources, identifying drift without making changes.

## 11. Best Practices for Terraform in CI/CD

- **Use Remote State**: Store state in S3 with DynamoDB locking to enable safe collaboration.  
- **Modularize Code**: Break Terraform into reusable modules for VPC, EKS, and Node Groups.  
- **Version Providers**: Pin provider versions in `.tf` files to prevent unexpected upgrades.  
- **Validate Early**: Run `terraform validate` as part of security scans.  
- **Use Small Environments**: Keep dev/test clusters lightweight to optimize costs.  
- **Destroy Unused Resources**: Use `action=destroy` for temporary environments.  

---

## 12. Future Improvements

The Terraform implementation here can evolve with:

- **Policy as Code**: Integrate Sentinel or OPA to enforce compliance.  
- **Helm Provider**: Deploy Kubernetes apps directly from Terraform using Helm charts.  
- **Cost Estimation**: Integrate Infracost to show financial impact before apply.  
- **More Environments**: Expand tfvars for staging, performance, and production.  
- **Multi-Cloud Readiness**: Adapt providers for GCP or Azure.  

---

## 13. Conclusion
